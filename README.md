# Three.js Journey

This repository showcases my journey with Three.js, where I experiment with different 3D scenes, animations, and interactive visual elements using WebGL. The goal is to explore the possibilities of Three.js and improve my skills in creating immersive web experiences.

## ðŸš€ What You'll Find
- Basic 3D scene setup with Three.js
- Custom shaders and materials
- Interactive 3D models
- Physics and particle simulations
- Creative WebGL experiments

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
```
/threejs-journey
â”‚-- /scenes  # Collection of different Three.js projects
â”‚-- /shaders # Custom GLSL shaders
â”‚-- /textures # Textures used in projects
â”‚-- index.html # Main entry point
â”‚-- script.js  # Core Three.js logic
â”‚-- README.md # This file
```

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Three.js** - 3D Graphics Library
- **JavaScript** - Core scripting language
- **GLSL** - Custom shaders for materials and effects
- **WebGL** - Hardware-accelerated rendering

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Acid-OP/threejs-journey.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd threejs-journey
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or start a local server:
   ```sh
   npx http-server
   ```

## ðŸŒŸ Future Plans
- Adding physics-based interactions
- Implementing post-processing effects
- Creating a portfolio-worthy interactive 3D experience
